Coding for fun because i forgot to buy bread yesterday! :)

This is a simple To-Do List Application built using Python's tkinter for the GUI and sqlite3 for database operations. The application allows users to add, remove, and manage tasks efficiently, with the task data being persisted in a local SQLite database.

# Features

•	Add Task: Users can input a task title and add it to their to-do list.

•	Remove Task: Selected tasks can be removed from the list.

•	Delete All Tasks: Users can delete all tasks at once with a confirmation prompt.

•	Persistent Storage: All tasks are saved in a local SQLite database (listOfTasks.db), ensuring that tasks are retained even after the application is closed.

•	User-Friendly Interface: The interface is designed to be simple and easy to navigate, making task management straightforward.

# Requirements:

•	tkinter 

•	sqlite3
